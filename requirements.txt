# Note: Current CIOP implementation focuses on institutional analysis
# These dependencies support:
# - Policy impact assessment and modeling
# - Legal framework analysis and comparison  
# - Stakeholder mapping and social network analysis
# - Economic modeling for stewardship systems
# - International cooperation and standards analysis
# - Institutional data management and analysis

# For basic CIOP functionality, core packages are sufficient
# Advanced features require domain-specific packages based on implementation context
