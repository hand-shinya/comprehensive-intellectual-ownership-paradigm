abstract: >-
  The Comprehensive Intellectual Ownership Paradigm (CIOP) represents a fundamental 
  reconceptualization of intellectual property rights for the AI era. Moving beyond 
  traditional ownership models that treat knowledge as commodity, CIOP establishes a 
  framework for collective intellectual stewardship that preserves individual creative 
  agency while enabling collaborative knowledge evolution. This paradigm addresses the 
  profound challenges posed by AI-generated content, collaborative human-AI creation, 
  and the need for sustainable knowledge ecosystems in an age of rapid technological 
  advancement.
