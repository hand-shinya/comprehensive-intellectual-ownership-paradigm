title: "Comprehensive Intellectual Ownership Paradigm: Redefining Knowledge Property in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"
version: "1.0.0"
abstract: "The Comprehensive Intellectual Ownership Paradigm (CIOP) represents a fundamental reconceptualization of intellectual property rights for the AI era. Moving beyond traditional ownership models that treat knowledge as commodity, CIOP establishes a framework for collective intellectual stewardship that preserves individual creative agency while enabling collaborative knowledge evolution. This paradigm addresses the profound challenges posed by AI-generated content, collaborative human-AI creation, and the need for sustainable knowledge ecosystems in an age of rapid technological advancement."
